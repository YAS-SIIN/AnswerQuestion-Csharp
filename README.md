# CGMGroupTask-Csharp

Language: Csharp

 

Write a Csharp console application that gives me two options. One to ask a specific question and the other option is to add questions and their answers
 

Therefore the following restrictions apply:

- A Question is a String with max 255 chars
- An Answer is a String with max 255 chars
- A Question can have multiple answers (like bullet points)
- If the user asks a question it has to be exactly the same as entered – no “best match”.
- If the user asks a question which is not stored yet the program should print “the answer to life, universe and everything is 42” according to “The hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy”
- If the user asks a question whish is  stored the program should print all answers to that question. Every Answer in a separate line
Adding a question looks like:

```
 <question>? “<answer1>” “<answer2>” “<answerX>”
 Char “?” is the separator between question and answers
 Every Question needs to have at least one answer but can have unlimited answers all inside of char “
Provide tests for the functionality described in 1)
```

Provide the source code on any GIT repo worldwide (GITLAB, GITHUB, whatever you prefer and/or use)

 No other restrictions apply
 



## Example

Adding a question:
What is Peters favorite food? “Pizza” “Spaghetti” “Ice cream”

Asking a question which is in the system:
What is Peters favorite food?

Answers will be
 - Pizza
 - Spaghetti
 - Ice cream
 - Asking a question which is not in the system:
When is Peters birthday?
Answer will be
 - the answer to life, universe and everything is 42
